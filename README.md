# f1-voting-system

This is an F1 Driver of the Day Voting system project using socket programming with the TCP protocol. We have implemented a multi-threaded voting server using Python's socket and threading libraries. It listens for incoming connections, authenticates voters, processes votes, and uses locks to manage concurrent access to shared resources (like a database).
